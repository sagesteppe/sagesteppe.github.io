I have worked as a field botanist in Western North America since graduating from the Evergreen State College in 2014. Most of my experience is in semi-arid, and arid land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Although I have worked professionally from roughly 3 to ~ 13,000+ feet

I have a broad range of academic interests. I am largely interested in the revisionary systematics and taxonomy of clades of species endemic to Western North America, and am always happy to collaborate as a field collector for phylogenomic projects. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you are interested in acquiring plant material, I may be in an area where I can assist. 

Conservation genetics and genomics fascinate me, especially inferring historic gene flow across landscapes. 

I am also largely interested in how computers can make our lives easier, and assist in conservation endeavors. For this I code extensively in the statistical programming language R, as well as Python, Bash, and use styling elements from Latex, HTML, CSS.
